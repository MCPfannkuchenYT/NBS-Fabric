# NBS-Fabric
A Note Block Studio File Player for Minecraft

Allows you to play .nbs Files from the Note Block Studio Program in Minecraft, with the pure use of your hand and standalone noteblocks.
This Works on Servers, but please only do this if you are allowed to. Does not work with Anti-Cheats (obviously)

## How to Use

#### Prebuilt

Go to the [releases](https://github.com/MCPfannkuchenYT/NBS-Fabric/releases) Page and download the NBS Player for 1.16.X

#### Compile
